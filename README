DESCRIPTION
-----------

Library designed for deal with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Also, a simple
example is provided.


COMPILING
---------

Compile it entering the command "make". You will need the GCC compiler and the
GNU Make tool.


RUNNING THE TEST PROGRAM
------------------------

	Usage: bignumber

  The program evaluates the largest known prime number, the Mersenne prime
2^43,112,609 - 1, with 12,978,189 digits (N_DIGITS has been set to 2^24, that
is, 16777216). The algorithm used to obtain the former number is detailed in
the source code. You will need about 20 minutes and 1,3 GB of RAM memory to run
the program with the current configuration in a "normal" computer (2 GHz CPU).
If that's too much for you, you can compute a cheaper Mersenne prime, but
remember to adjust N_DIGITS to a lower value (e.g., you can compute the number 
2^3,021,377 - 1, with 909,526 digits, with N_DIGITS = 1048576, in about 35
seconds).

The result should be:

> result = 316470269...697152511::(12978189 digits, 12978189 integer and 0
    fractional)
